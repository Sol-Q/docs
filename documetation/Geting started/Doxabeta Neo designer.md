## A brief overview of doxabeta Neo 

When you create a project, open the Application model page, which is a list of the classes (essentially, a set of elements) that describe the domain of the application and its functionality. Doxabeta Neo allows you to create different types of classes from simple entities (application objects) and forms to private types and business servers. Classes can also be created during creation of the diagram. Diagrams allow not only for you to create classes, but also to establish relationship between them, which in the future will allow to associate different forms in the application. Also, some types of diagrams help to detail the subject area, to describe the processes that must be implemented by the application. Naviagtion allows you to create a menu of the application to distribute forms groups and/ or roles. Generation allows you to create a working prototype application, which is suitable for the initial demonstration to the customer. On this basis the application is easy to modify in accordance with the wishes of the customer as the main points of the subject area had been introduced. The ap can be configure in accordance with the needs of your application, specify the path generation for client and server parts of the application, to Supplement the description. Also the settings menu option allows to delete the project

## Generation settings
If needed, generation can be splited for client and server parts. The server part is usually used for “complex” algorithms, so not to overload the user interface. The client part is needed to process fast tasks. Login, password for the client part repository and branch for the client part, as well as similar fields for the backend part are used if you need to generate an application in an existing repository. If you do not have a repository yet, the designer will create a new repository on Githab by the project name (it will generate and bind ssh keys), and generates code in the created repository. In addition, the project may be published in gh-pages. It is also possible to change localization (the language which the designer displays) and the theme designer. To export project need to open the Settings page and under Project Action with the project to choose I want to export project. You can also make backup project, click the button I want to do Project backup.
