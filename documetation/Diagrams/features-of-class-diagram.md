## Recommendations for drawing class diagrams
There are recommendations for drawing a class diagram:

* The direction of the relationship 
    * Master associations are drawn "sideways". 
    * Children's compositions are drawn "down".
    * Inheritance is drawn "up” 


* Link Naming 
    * The name of the master is usually the same as the name of the class.
    * The name of the child (the name that the collection will bear in the object model) is usually plural.
    * Associations of the association type must be named on the part of the master, the composition type - on both sides.

* Connection Parameters
    * Classes united by a connection with a multiplicity of "1:1” are combined into one class.
    * Aggregation type relationships are replaced by either Association or Composition
