**Class diagram** - one of the available kinds of graphs supported Doxabeta Neo.

The class diagram is a key element of the UML diagram editor sice applications are often generated from the class diagram. The class diagram is a collection of static declarative model elements. Class diagrams can be used with the direct design, that is in the process of developing new systems and reverse engineering - description of existing and used systems. Information from the class diagram directly displayed in the applicationâ€™s source code. Thus, the class diagram is the final result of the design and the starting point of the development process.

## Features of building class diagram
The main features of building classes are  provided in the following articles:

* [The key concepts of object-oriented framework for application systems, developed in doxabeta neo](keyConcepts.md).
* [Features of construction of the class diagram](features-of-class-diagram.md).


## Specific features of class diagrams
Main features when working with the diagram provided in the article Editor UML diagrams.

Specific diagrams features:

* Change stereotype class via the context menu.
* View dependencies through the context menu (functioning similarly to the dependency mapping class class Manager).


## The main elements of class diagrams

On the class diagram, you can display the following elements of UML notation that are available in the Toolbox:
