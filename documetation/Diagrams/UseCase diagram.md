Diagram of use cases - one of the available kinds of graphs supported Doxabeta Neo.

![Example](/Diagrams/Use-case-diagram.png)


The main elements of the chart - participant (actor) and precedent (option).

Participant is a set of logically related roles with interaction with precedent or entity (system, subsystem, or class). A participant may be human or another system, subsystem, or class that represent something outside of nature. Graphically, the party represented “the man”.

Precedent (use case) - a description of a set of successive events (including alternatives) performed by the system, which lead to the observed participant results. Precedent represents the behavior of an entity, describing the interaction between the participants and the system. Precedent does not indicate “how” achieved some results, but only “what” it is done. Precedents are identified in a very simple way - in the form of an ellipse, inside which stated his name.
